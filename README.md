# Policy Gradient Algorithms and DDPG

This notebook contains the implementation of various Policy Gradient Algorithms like Vanilla PG, Reward to Go and Reinforce with Baseline along with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient on CartPole Atari Game. This notebook also visualises the comparision of each of these algorithm with the help of a plot between the score and iteration.
